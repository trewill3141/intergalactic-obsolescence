## About Me
I've been fortunate enough in my career to make my way from sales >> marketing ops >> SEO/PPC >> analytics/BI >> engineering. Each of these roles has provided valuable insight into designing, building, and delivering impactful and robust business intelligence solutions that meet the organization's needs. I’m “one of the lucky ones” in that I get to do what I’m passionate about for a living, and I don’t take that for granted.
